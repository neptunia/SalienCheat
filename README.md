# How to use this

## First steps

forked from steamdb's repo but changed for different group + allows for hardcoded targeting of a given tile
also i deleted everything that wasn't python

1. Join group (needed to represent captures)
2. Open https://steamcommunity.com/saliengame/gettoken and save it as `token.txt` in same folder as `cheat.php`
3. Select PHP or Python version of the script, you don't need both



## Python

0. (optional) Setup virtual env: `virtualenv env && source env/bin/activate`
1. `pip install requests tqdm`
2. Run the script: `python cheat.py`
